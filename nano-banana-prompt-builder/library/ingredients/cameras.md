## Lens Choices

### By Feeling (What You Want to Achieve)

| What You Want | Technical Term | Plain English |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Subject pops, background blurry** | 85mm f/1.4 | Beautiful portrait lens, creamy background blur |
| **Natural, like how you see it** | 50mm f/1.8 | "Normal" lens, honest and intimate |
| **See the whole scene** | 35mm f/2.8 | Wider view, great for environmental shots |
| **Epic, grand scale** | 24mm wide angle | Dramatic wide view, makes spaces feel big |
| **Tiny world, extreme detail** | Macro 85mm f/2.8 | Gets super close, shows tiny details |
| **Cinematic movie look** | Anamorphic lens | Wide frame, cool lens flares, Hollywood style |

### Depth of Field (Background Blur)

| Effect | Technical | When to Use |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Very blurry background** | f/1.4 - f/2.0, shallow DOF | Portraits, making subject stand out |
| **Somewhat blurry** | f/2.8 - f/4.0, moderate DOF | Balance of subject and environment |
| **Everything sharp** | f/8 - f/11, deep DOF | Landscapes, showing full scene detail |

**Prompt language:**
- "shallow depth of field with creamy bokeh background"
- "deep focus with sharp background detail"
- "beautiful background blur separating subject"

## Camera Angles

### By Feeling (Emotional Impact)

| Feeling You Want | Angle | Technical Term | Effect |
|------------------|-------|----------------|--------|
| **Powerful, heroic** | Looking UP at subject | Low angle | Makes subject dominant, impressive |
| **Equal, relatable** | Straight on | Eye level | Neutral, connects viewer to subject |
| **Vulnerable, small** | Looking DOWN at subject | High angle | Makes subject seem smaller, observed |
| **Uneasy, dynamic** | Tilted camera | Dutch angle | Creates tension, unease, action |
| **Tiny world feel** | Very low, looking up | Worm's eye view | Subject towers above, epic scale |
| **God's view** | Directly above | Bird's eye view | Overview, pattern, detachment |

**Prompt language:**
- "low angle shot looking up for powerful heroic perspective"
- "eye-level angle creating intimate connection"
- "worm's eye view emphasizing massive scale"

## Shot Types (Framing)

### By What You Want to Show

| What to Show | Shot Type | Abbreviation | Best For |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Eyes, expression detail** | Extreme Close-up | ECU | Emotion, intensity |
| **Face fills frame** | Close-up | CU | Portraits, emotional impact |
| **Head and shoulders** | Medium Close-up | MCU | Interviews, connection |
| **Waist up** | Medium Shot | MS | Body language + face |
| **Knees up** | Medium Long Shot | MLS | More context, movement |

## Composition Rules

### Simple Guide for Better Framing

| Rule | What It Means | When to Use |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Rule of thirds** | Subject off-center at intersection points | Most shots, more dynamic |
| **Center framing** | Subject dead center | Power, symmetry, confrontation |
| **Leading lines** | Lines in image point to subject | Drawing attention, depth |
| **Negative space** | Empty area around subject | Breathing room, text space |
| **Framing** | Natural elements frame subject | Focus, depth, context |
| **Symmetry** | Balanced left/right | Formal, powerful, architectural |

**Prompt language:**
- "rule of thirds composition with subject offset"
- "centered symmetrical framing for powerful impact"
- "negative space on left for text placement"
