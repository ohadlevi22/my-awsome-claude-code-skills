    "artistic_style": "Authentic street art mural, visible and expressive brushstrokes, artistic paint splatters, matte finish, weathered and slightly distressed paint textures.",
    "background_wall": "An old, heavily textured Mediterranean stone wall with visible cracks and natural grain that shows through the layers of paint.",
    "3d_integration": "A real, physical wine glass filled with deep red wine sits on a small, weathered stone ledge protruding from the wall, perfectly aligned with the painted hand so the fingers appear to be gripping the glass stem.",
    "lighting_and_atmosphere": "Soft, warm golden hour lighting, cinematic shadows, intimate courtyard atmosphere, dreamy and romantic mood.",
    "technical_details": "8k resolution, ultra-detailed wall textures, sharp focus on the interaction between the physical glass and the painted mural, masterpiece quality.",

  }
}
```

## Macro Miniature World

### Office Paperclip Push (Male)
**Style:** Macro Miniature | **Category:** Workplace Humor | **For:** Men

```
Image Type: Ultra-realistic macro photography.

Content: A miniature athletic man in a gray t-shirt and dark trousers,
straining and leaning his whole body weight to push a giant silver paperclip
across a mahogany desk.
In the blurred background, a giant female manager is looking at a tablet,
unaware of his presence.

Style & Lighting: Cinematic lighting with deep shadows and sharp highlights.
The man must cast a realistic contact shadow on the desk surface.

Technical: Low-angle "worm's eye view" to emphasize scale.
85mm lens, f/2.8 for shallow depth of field.
Focus is razor-sharp on the man's expression of effort.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specific action (pushing) creates narrative
- Contact shadow requirement ensures realism
- Background giant creates scale reference
- Technical specs are precise

### Keyboard Enter Key (Female)
**Style:** Macro Miniature | **Category:** Workplace / Tech | **For:** Women

```
Image Type: High-fidelity macro product photography.

Content: A miniature woman is standing on a giant silver laptop keyboard.
She is leaning her whole body weight to push down the "Enter" key with both hands.
The blue glow from the giant laptop screen illuminates her face and suit.

Scale & Texture: The key she is pushing is half her height.
You can see the micro-texture and dust particles on the giant keys.

Lighting: Dramatic cool light from the screen and warm ambient office light
from the side, creating complex, realistic reflections on her clothes.

Technical: 85mm lens, eye-level angle relative to the character.
Nano Banana Pro Thinking Mode enabled for spatial accuracy.
```

**Why it works:**
- Multiple light sources (screen + ambient) create depth
- Micro-texture details sell the scale
- Specific scale reference ("half her height")
- Physical interaction with specific key

## Fantasy Crossover

### Disney World Integration (Female)
**Style:** Fantasy Crossover | **Category:** Animated World | **For:** Women

```
Create a cinematic fantasy portrait of the main character standing at the center
of a magical world inspired by classic Disney-style animation.

The character remains realistic and detailed, while iconic animated characters
surround them naturally as part of the scene.

Soft magical lighting, rich colors, cinematic depth of field,
whimsical yet emotional atmosphere.

The scene feels like a moment from an epic animated movie where the character
belongs to the world, not a costume or parody.
```

**Why it works:**
- Clear instruction: person REALISTIC, world ANIMATED
- "belongs to the world, not a costume or parody" - critical phrase
- Emotional language guides the mood
- Concise but complete

### Gentle Giant in Village (Male)
**Style:** Fantasy Crossover | **Category:** Scale Fantasy | **For:** Men

```
Ultra-realistic cinematic fantasy photograph.
A giant man kneels gently inside a realistic medieval village deep in a forest.

He is human-sized compared to the trees, while the villagers are normal adult
human beings at their true scale — not toys, not miniatures.

The small people are fully realistic humans:
They move naturally, walk, gesture, turn their heads, react emotionally.
Some step back cautiously, others raise their hands.
One man stands in shallow water with wet boots.
Another leans against a wooden fence, frozen in awe.

Their clothing shows natural wear:
Wrinkles, dirt, uneven fabric, imperfect stitching.
Faces are expressive and human, captured mid-reaction —
surprise, fear, curiosity, wonder.

The giant man interacts delicately with the environment:
His large hands gently touch the grass and soil near the villagers.
Plants, moss, and earth bend under real physical pressure.
Water ripples realistically around his fingers.
Shadows from his body fall naturally across the houses and people.

His posture is calm, protective, and attentive — not threatening.
His expression is focused, thoughtful, emotionally present.

Cinematic depth of field.
Natural forest light rays filtering through trees.
Documentary-style realism.

This is NOT a miniature scene.
NOT a diorama.
NOT toy-like.
Everything feels alive, grounded, and physically real.
```

**Why it works:**
- Extremely detailed about what makes people REALISTIC
- Physical interaction details (water ripples, plants bending)
- Emotional descriptions for each character
- Strong "NOT" statements prevent miniature look
- Documentary-style language grounds the fantasy

## Fine Art Conceptual

### Glass Sphere Portrait (Female)
**Style:** Fine Art Conceptual | **Category:** Symbolic Portrait | **For:** Women

```json
{
  "use_reference_images": true,
  "reference_images": "attach 2-3 clear face photos of the person",

  "prompt": "An artistic portrait where the person appears enclosed within a transparent glass sphere or bubble.\n\nThe sphere is elegant and minimal, with refined reflections and subtle light refraction.\n\nThe person inside looks confident and serene, sharply focused.\n\nThe background is minimalist, studio-like, with soft gradients and dramatic yet clean lighting.\n\nThe image feels modern, luxurious, and symbolic — like a cover image or gallery artwork.\n\nNo fantasy creatures, no surreal distortion.",

  "negative_prompt": "fantasy creatures, childish style, heavy textures, cluttered background",

  "style": "fine art contemporary portrait",
  "lighting": "studio lighting with controlled reflections",
  "quality": "ultra"
}
```

**Why it works:**
- Clear symbolic concept (sphere = isolation? protection? display?)
- Emotional descriptors: "confident and serene"
- Reference to gallery/cover quality sets standard
- Clean separation of prompt elements in JSON

### Marionette Puppeteer (Female)
**Style:** Fine Art Conceptual | **Category:** Self-Reflection | **For:** Women

```
A high-end conceptual fashion portrait of a woman acting as a marionette puppeteer.
She is wearing a tailored red suit, a deep blue shirt underneath,
and a soft blue ribbon tied around her neck, elegant and confident.

In front of her, suspended by visible thin strings, is a marionette puppet
designed as a stylized version of the woman herself.
The marionette is clearly a wood-and-fabric puppet, with articulated joints,
slightly exaggerated proportions, and visible craftsmanship —
wooden limbs, painted face, fabric clothing.

The puppet wears a miniature red suit with blue accents, echoing the woman's outfit,
but in a clearly theatrical, handcrafted style.
The woman is holding the control cross (marionette controller) above,
actively manipulating the strings — clearly showing control, intention, and performance.

The relationship feels artistic, symbolic, and playful,
not dark or creepy — more theatre, identity, and self-reflection than realism.

Lighting is cinematic and refined, highlighting textures:
wood grain, fabric, stitching, and tailored clothing.
Background is a dark, painterly studio backdrop or soft gradient,
elegant and atmospheric.

Mood: theatrical elegance, self-awareness, creative control.
Camera: medium to full portrait, eye-level or slightly low angle.
Style: editorial fashion photography meets fine-art theatre imagery.
Ultra-detailed, high resolution, professional studio quality.

Avoid: lifelike dolls, human replicas, porcelain realism, uncanny or horror aesthetics
```

**Why it works:**
- Rich conceptual meaning (self-control, identity, performance)
- Explicit that puppet is PUPPET not creepy doll
- Color coordination creates visual cohesion
- Clear mood guidance prevents horror interpretation
- Texture vocabulary throughout
