# Street Art Mural

## Plain English
Portrait painted as authentic street art on weathered walls - but with the option to integrate real 3D objects for magical mixed-reality effects. Think Banksy meets fine art, with beautiful textures and urban character.

## When to Use
- Urban artistic portraits
- Street art style imagery
- Mixed reality (real objects + painted elements)
- Textured, weathered aesthetic
- Creative wall mural concepts

## Key Ingredients

### Camera
- **Lens**: 35-50mm (captures wall context)
- **Angle**: Straight-on to wall, or slight angle for depth
- **Framing**: Medium shot showing wall texture and context
- **Depth**: Deep focus to show wall texture, or selective for 3D elements

### Lighting
- **Style**: Natural, warm, atmospheric
- **Direction**: Golden hour side light or soft overcast
- **Quality**: Soft shadows that enhance wall texture
- **Effects**: Shadows from 3D elements on painted surface

### Textures (CRITICAL)
- Weathered wall surface (cracks, chips, natural aging)
- Visible brushstrokes and paint texture
- Matte paint finish (not glossy)
- Real object textures contrasting with painted elements

## Example Prompts

### Romantic Portrait with 3D Wine Glass
```
A romantic street art mural of this person with a gentle smile
and expressive eyes, raising their hand in a celebratory toast.

Artistic style: Authentic street art mural, visible and expressive
brushstrokes, artistic paint splatters, matte finish,
weathered and slightly distressed paint textures.

Background wall: An old, heavily textured Mediterranean stone wall
with visible cracks and natural grain that shows through
the layers of paint.

3D integration: A real, physical wine glass filled with deep red wine
sits on a small, weathered stone ledge protruding from the wall,
perfectly aligned with the painted hand so the fingers appear
to be gripping the glass stem.

Lighting: Soft, warm golden hour lighting, cinematic shadows,
intimate courtyard atmosphere, dreamy and romantic mood.

Technical: 8K resolution, ultra-detailed wall textures,
sharp focus on the interaction between the physical glass
and the painted mural, masterpiece quality.

Negative: photographic skin, smooth plastic texture, blurry,
low resolution, glossy finish, watermark, distorted hands,
messy paint on glass.

### Urban Portrait Mural
```
A striking street art mural portrait of this person,
painted in bold expressive style on a weathered brick wall.

The portrait captures their likeness with artistic interpretation -
visible brushstrokes, intentional drips, spray paint effects
at the edges.

The brick wall is old and textured - some bricks are chipped,
mortar is crumbling in places, previous graffiti tags peek
through layers of paint.

Warm afternoon sunlight rakes across the wall at an angle,
highlighting every bump and texture in the brick surface,
casting soft shadows from the paint buildup.

Medium shot capturing the portrait and surrounding wall context.
Straight-on angle respecting the wall surface.

Authentic Banksy-meets-classical-portrait quality.
Urban, artistic, thought-provoking atmosphere.
The mural looks like it's been there for months, naturally aging
with the wall.

8K resolution, hyper-detailed wall and paint textures.
```

### Interactive Mural with Real Elements
```
A playful street art mural of this child reaching out with both hands,
painted on an old wooden fence with peeling paint.

3D integration: Real colorful balloons are tied to a small hook
on the fence, positioned so the painted hands appear to be
releasing them into the sky.

The mural style is whimsical and joyful - soft colors,
gentle brushstrokes, slightly stylized proportions.
Paint appears to be acrylic, with visible texture from brush marks.

The wooden fence shows its age - weathered gray wood grain,
old paint peeling in places, rusty nail heads visible.

Soft overcast lighting creates even illumination,
no harsh shadows, colors remain vibrant.
Real balloon strings cast subtle shadows on the painted surface.

Captures the magic of street art coming to life.
Whimsical, joyful, childhood wonder atmosphere.
8K resolution, sharp detail on both painted and real elements.
```

## Negative Prompt Defaults
```
photographic skin texture, smooth airbrushed finish,
glossy paint, wet looking surface, digital art style,
clean perfect wall, new construction, pristine surface,
floating elements without shadows, obvious photoshop,
unrealistic integration, paint bleeding onto real objects,
blurry textures, low resolution wall detail
```

## Pro Tips
1. Wall texture is everything - specify cracks, weathering, material
2. Matte finish is essential - glossy looks fake
3. Visible brushstrokes sell the "painted" effect
4. 3D elements need shadows on the painted surface
5. Aging and weathering make it feel authentic
6. The wall should have character and history
7. Alignment between painted and real elements must be precise
