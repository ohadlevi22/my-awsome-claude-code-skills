# Cartoon Animation

## Plain English
Transform photos into 2D animated cartoon characters like they stepped out of a Nickelodeon or Disney Channel show. Think The Loud House, Gravity Falls, The Casagrandes, Big City Greens - bold outlines, flat colors, exaggerated expressive features.

## When to Use

## Key Ingredients

### Camera
- **Angle**: Front-facing or 3/4 view (classic character portrait)
- **Framing**: Upper body or full character, centered
- **Style**: Character sheet / model sheet aesthetic
- **Focus**: Sharp throughout (no depth of field blur)

### Lighting
- **Style**: Flat, even lighting (standard cartoon look)
- **Shadows**: Minimal or none - clean and simple
- **Quality**: No dramatic lighting effects
- **Colors**: Bright, saturated, cheerful palette

### Textures & Details
- Bold, consistent black outlines (like TV animation cels)

## Pro Tips
1. **Likeness is key** - Always emphasize "maintaining recognizable features" so the person can identify themselves
2. **Flat is the goal** - These styles avoid shading; if you see gradients, add stronger negative prompts
3. **Name the show** - Referencing specific shows (Loud House, Gravity Falls, Casagrandes) helps Nano Banana understand the exact aesthetic
4. **Simple backgrounds** - Solid colors or simple cartoon environments work best; complex backgrounds can distract
5. **Expression matters** - Cartoon characters are expressive; specify the emotion/pose you want
6. **Avoid anime keywords** - "Anime" and "manga" create a very different style; keep them in negatives

## Style Variations

### More Expressive (Gravity Falls style)
Add: "highly expressive cartoon face, dynamic pose, quirky character design"

### Cleaner/Simpler (Big City Greens style)
Add: "very simple clean shapes, minimal details, bold graphic style"

### Warmer/Softer (Steven Universe style)
Add: "soft rounded shapes, pastel color palette, gentle friendly expression"
