# Macro Miniature World

## Plain English
Tiny realistic people in a giant everyday world - like "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" or "Ant-Man". Creates surreal, fun images where people interact with oversized everyday objects.

## When to Use
- Creative workplace/office scenes
- Surreal adventures in everyday settings
- Fun conceptual images
- Scale-based storytelling
- Making mundane objects feel epic

## Key Ingredients

### Camera
- **Lens**: 85mm macro lens
- **Angle**: Low "worm's eye view" - looking UP at tiny subject
- **Framing**: Subject small in frame, giant objects dominating
- **Depth**: Shallow DOF (f/2.8), sharp subject, blurred giant background

### Lighting
- **Style**: Dramatic cinematic with strong shadows
- **Direction**: Side or rim lighting for depth
- **Quality**: Sharp highlights, deep shadows
- **Effects**: Screen glow (for tech scenes), environmental reflections

### Critical Details
- **Contact shadows**: Subject MUST cast realistic shadow on surface
- **Scale references**: Giant everyday objects (paperclips, keys, keyboards)
- **Surface textures**: Visible micro-texture on giant objects (dust, grain)
- **Physical interaction**: Subject actively pushing, climbing, interacting

## Prompt Template

```
Image Type: Ultra-realistic macro photography.

Content: A miniature [person description] [action/pose] [interacting with giant object] on/in [surface/location].
[Background element with giant person/object for scale contrast].

Scale & Texture: [Object] is [size relative to person].
Visible micro-texture and dust particles on giant [surfaces].

Lighting: [Primary light source] with [secondary light],
creating complex realistic reflections on [surfaces/clothing].

Technical: [Lens] lens, [angle] relative to the miniature character.
Focus is razor-sharp on [focal point].
The miniature person must cast a realistic contact shadow on [surface].

This is NOT a miniature scene. NOT a diorama. NOT toy-like.
Everything feels alive, grounded, and physically real.
```

## Example Prompts

### Office Paperclip Push
```
Image Type: Ultra-realistic macro photography.

Content: A miniature athletic man in a gray t-shirt and dark trousers,
straining and leaning his whole body weight to push a giant silver paperclip
across a mahogany desk.
In the blurred background, a giant female manager is looking at a tablet,
unaware of his presence.

Scale & Texture: The paperclip is twice his height.
Visible micro-texture and dust particles on the desk surface.

Lighting: Cinematic lighting with deep shadows and sharp highlights.
The man must cast a realistic contact shadow on the desk surface.

Technical: Low-angle "worm's eye view" to emphasize scale.
85mm lens, f/2.8 for shallow depth of field.
Focus is razor-sharp on the man's expression of effort.

This is NOT a miniature scene. NOT a diorama. NOT toy-like.
Everything feels alive, grounded, and physically real.
```

### Keyboard Enter Key
```
Image Type: High-fidelity macro product photography.

Content: A miniature woman in a tailored business suit standing on a giant
silver laptop keyboard. She is leaning her whole body weight to push down
the "Enter" key with both hands.
The blue glow from the giant laptop screen illuminates her face and suit.

Scale & Texture: The key she is pushing is half her height.
You can see the micro-texture and dust particles on the giant keys.

Lighting: Dramatic cool light from the screen and warm ambient office light
from the side, creating complex, realistic reflections on her clothes.

Technical: 85mm lens, eye-level angle relative to the character.
Shallow depth of field with sharp focus on her determined expression.
She casts a realistic contact shadow on the keyboard surface.

This is NOT a miniature scene. NOT a diorama. NOT toy-like.
Everything feels alive, grounded, and physically real.
```

### Coffee Cup Climb
```
Image Type: Ultra-realistic macro photography.

Content: A miniature rock climber scaling the outside of a giant white
ceramic coffee mug. Steam rises from above creating atmospheric haze.
A giant hand reaches toward the mug handle in the blurred background.

Scale & Texture: The mug is a towering cliff to the climber.
Visible ceramic texture, coffee stains, and fingerprints on the mug surface.

Lighting: Warm morning light from a window, steam catching the light rays.
Deep shadows on the far side of the mug.

Technical: 85mm macro, low angle looking up at the climber.
f/2.8 shallow depth of field.
Focus razor-sharp on the climber's grip and concentration.
Realistic contact shadow where hands and feet touch ceramic.

This is NOT a miniature scene. NOT a diorama. NOT toy-like.
Everything feels alive, grounded, and physically real.
```

## Negative Prompt Defaults
```
toy, plastic, diorama, miniature model, dollhouse, fake, cartoon,
tilt-shift effect, obvious photoshop, floating without shadows,
no contact shadow, unrealistic scale, anime, illustration,
smooth plastic texture, toy-like proportions
```

## Pro Tips
1. **Contact shadows are CRITICAL** - without them it looks fake
2. Always state "NOT a diorama, NOT toy-like" - this is essential for Nano Banana
3. Include texture details (dust, micro-texture) for realism
4. Worm's eye view sells the scale difference
5. Having a giant person/object in background reinforces scale
6. Physical interaction (pushing, climbing) makes it believable
